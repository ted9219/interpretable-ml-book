### Rule Extraction and Model Extraction

Some methods, which are all only tested on single hidden layer networks.
- KT method: Extract for each neuron a rule
- Extract decision tree (Hinton)
- CRED (2001, Sato and Tsukimoto)
- Trepan

- Model tree distillation (for CNNs)

Types of rule extraction: Decompositional, Pedagogical, Eclectic
Pedagogical is simply model-agnostic.

You can also look at different levels:
Approximate the rules of a single neuron
Approximate the whole network classification.
